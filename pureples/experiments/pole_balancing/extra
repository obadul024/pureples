I attended the wedding of a woman I loved,
Stared at her face as she adorned the crimson red,
Soon she would sign and belong to him,
Congratulated her as she wiped her tears,

I attended the wedding of a woman I loved,
Remembered the day we scarawled our names in adobe walls,
Pale her slender her wrists were mine,
Yearning lips finding paths to be one,

I attended the wedding of a woman I loved,
I colored the greys she loved, 
My temples were yours my dove,

I attended the wedding of a woman I loved,
The gold shimmering in her wrists mine they were,
Garlands of rubies were her hands,

Her eyes were oceans pouring,
I was a star imploding,

I attended the wedding of a woman I loved,
Goodbye, all your life may you never rest
